## Usage

The main program window consists of an interactive seating plan, which takes up the majority of the window space.
The right side of the window transitions between 3 panels.
  1. The movie selection panel, where you are able to select the movie, session time and theatre for booking.
  2. The ticket selection panel, where you are able to choose your tickets and review prices.
  3. The seat allocation panel, which allows for the selection of your own and also a random contiguous placing of seats.
All data is saved on application exit.
