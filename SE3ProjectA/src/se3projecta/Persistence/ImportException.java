     * Appends the specified exception to the exceptions that were suppressed in
     * order to deliver this exception. This method is thread-safe and typically
     * called (automatically and implicitly) by the {@code try}-with-resources
     * statement.
     *
     * <p>The suppression behavior is enabled <em>unless</em> disabled null null
     * null null     {@linkplain #Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean) via
     * a constructor}. When suppression is disabled, this method does nothing
     * other than to validate its argument.
     *
     * <p>Note that when one exception Throwable causes} another exception,
     * the first exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
     * thrown in response. In other words, there is a causal connection
     * between the two exceptions.
     *
     * In contrast, there are situations where two independent exceptions can be
     * thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular in the {@code try} block of
     * a {@code try}-with-resources statement and the compiler-generated
     * {@code finally} block which closes the resource.
     *
     * In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be propagated.
     * In the {@code try}-with-resources statement, when there are two such
     * exceptions, the exception originating from the {@code try} block is
     * propagated and the exception from the {@code finally} block is added to
     * the list of exceptions suppressed by the exception from the {@code try}
     * block. As an exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
     * suppressed exceptions.
     *
     * <p>An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being caused by
     * another exception. Whether or not an exception has a cause is
     * semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike whether or not an
     * exception will suppress other exceptions which is typically only
     * determined after an exception is thrown.
     *
     * <p>Note that programmer written code is also able to take advantage of
     * calling this method in situations where there are multiple sibling
     * exceptions and only one can be propagated.
